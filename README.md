# HBS x FIS Summer 2020 gif-stravaganza

## Instructions
Find a GIF or image that summarizes how you're feeling about today being Friday. In a **branch**, add your gif to the images/ directory and embed the GIF using Markdown in this document (or embed a link to the gif directly!). I've provided an example! Then issue a pull request for the instructors to review.

Check the "Pull requests" tab to see both merged and unmerged examples of what your PR should look like!
